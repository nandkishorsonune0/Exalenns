This function takes in two arguments: 
an array of objects called blocks and an array of strings called reqs. 
It returns an integer representing the index of the block that is the 
best fit for the requirements given in reqs.

The first two lines of the function initialize the variables optimalBlock and minMaxDistance.
 optimalBlock will be used to store the index of the optimal block, and minMaxDistance will 
 be used to store the minimum maximum distance from a block to the nearest block satisfying 
 each requirement.

The next four lines create an auxiliary 2D array called distances which will be used to store 
the distances from each block to the nearest block satisfying each requirement.
 The distances array is initialized to have the same size as blocks, 
 and each element is initialized to an array filled with the value Infinity.

The next block of code is a nested loop which calculates the distances 
in a single pass through the blocks array. The outermost loop iterates 
over the indices of the blocks array. The second loop iterates over the 
elements of the reqs array. If the current block (blocks[i]) satisfies the 
current requirement (reqs[j]), then the distance is set to 0. If the current 
block does not satisfy the requirement, then a third loop iterates 
over the blocks array again to find the nearest block satisfying the requirement. 
If a block satisfying the requirement is found, the distance is updated to the absolute 
difference between the indices.
